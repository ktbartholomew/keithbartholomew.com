# What am I looking at?

This website simulates a Linux shell environment. You do things by typing the
name of a command, optionally adding extra information (called arguments),
then pressing enter to see the command’s output. For example, you just ran the
"cat" command to print the contents of this file!

Here are some other commands you can use:

* “open”: open a text file, image, or hyperlink
* “pwd”: show the name of the folder you’re currently in
* “ls”: list the contents of a folder, or the folder you’re currently in
* “cd”: move to another folder
* “cat”: print the contents of a file
* “sleep”: wait a certain number of seconds
* “reboot”: “reboot” the website
