# About Me

I’m Keith Bartholomew, and I’m currently working as a software developer for
Rackspace. I’m an expert JavaScript developer, whether browser-side or
server-side. I enjoy playing around with new JavaScript libraries as they come
out, but I’ve had the most time to get really comfortable with AngularJS,
React, Sass, and webpack. I’ve done everything from manipulating 3D objects
with three.js to building extensive admin UIs full of complex business logic.

## Other things I do

I’m an avid cyclist, riding well over 2,000 miles/year. I love to cook, but
don’t really like baking. I’m fond of fine whiskeys, wines, and coffees—in no
particular order.
