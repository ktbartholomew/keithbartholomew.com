# About Me

I’m Keith Bartholomew, and I’m a software developer for Rackspace. I’m an expert
JavaScript developer, whether browser-side or server-side. I've also started
writing lots of Go in the past couple years, and really enjoy it. I enjoy
playing around with new JavaScript libraries as they come out, but I’ve had the
most time to get really comfortable with React, Typescript, AngularJS, Sass, and
webpack. I’ve done everything from manipulating 3D objects with three.js to
building extensive admin UIs full of complex business logic. I'm a full-stack
developer in the most complete sense; I deploy and run things in containers on
Kubernetes, test them in [insert CI platform of choice], set up storage and
database infrastructure, and write all my own pixel-perfect CSS.

## Other things I do

I’m a competitive cyclist, riding well over 9,000 miles each year, and racing a
few times a month during the season. I love to cook, not necessarily making
gourmet dishes, but always impeccable and tasty comfort food. I especially enjoy
Italian and Japanese-inspired cooking. I’m fond of fine whiskeys, wines, and
coffees, in no particular order.
