# Carina

The Carina project was a rapidly developed containers-as-a-service offering from Rackspace. From the outset, we wanted something separate from the core Rackspace brand that would be synonymous with eye-watering speed and simplicity. We achieved just that, with a "zero to hero" onboarding process that could be completed by a brand-new user in around two minutes.

I was personally responsible for building the entire website and web app UI, as well as architecting Carina’s unique, streamlined signup process to securely integrate with Rackspace’s existing signup infrastructure, but with a significantly improved user experience.

Users were able to create bare metal, multi-node Docker Swarm clusters with the push of a button, then manage their clusters with a robust yet simple web UI or accompanying CLI.

Carina was eventually expanded to offer multi-node Kubernetes cluster with the push of a button, as well. The Carina project was ultimately a terrific success and a great learning experience for all involved, but the project was cancelled in 2017.
