I'm wrapping up a week in Las Vegas at [AWS re:Invent][reinvent], their _massive_ annual tech conference. I'll admit I had low expectations for the conference this year, mostly because I knew the recent frenzy around generative AI and chatbots was going to absolutely dominate the conversation. I was right about that, but there was a lot more to the discussion than just playing with chat bots. By the end of the conference I was still feeling that usual buzz of excitement, ready to get back to work and conquer the world.


### "Now Go Build"

The catchphrase of most of the keynotes this year was "Now Go Build". It usually followed announcements of lots of new and exciting developer tools, and it was a really powerful call to action. Amazon always brags about being customer-obsessed, and I think they did a good job of demonstrating that here. The point of the conference wasn't to thoughtfully learn and contemplate life and then keep doing things the way you'd always been doing them. The point was to collects a bunch of new and _very powerful_ tools, then get out there and build amazing things with it.
