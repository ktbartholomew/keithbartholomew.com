It's a well-worn cliché that developers overthink how to host their personal blogs, and I'm no exception to that. Web developers are a lucky bunch; if you gave us a pile of static HTML files and tolds us to edit them manually to maintain a website, we would get along just fine. That would be practical, but not very fun. And most of us aren't running personal websites out of necessity—we're doing it because it's fun! Developers _want_ their websites to be complicated, because a personal website is a low-stakes place to experiment with new ideas and show them to the world.

## A Brief History of my Website

Throughout the years, my personal website has been a reflection of my professional interests:

- **2010:** A combination of a hand-written PHP site and a WordPress blog which I decided should be brown for some reason. I bragged about my experience with jQuery and AJAX. [The Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20110307024459/http://www.keithbartholomew.com/) didn't capture this version of the site very well, but I remember that I had traced a photo of myself in Adobe Illustrator to appear as a cartoon-like effigy of myself at the top of every page.
- **2012:** I redesigned the WordPress blog and expanded it to handle the entire site. I was doing lots of tiny web development posts and demos, much like I'm doing now.

- **2013-2016:** I somehow resisted the urge to completely redesign my website, only giving it a minor style refresh (skeuomorphism was going out of style around this time). The biggest change during this time was that I migrated all the content to the [ExpressionEngine CMS](https://expressionengine.com/). I was growing tired of trying to make WordPress work well as a generic CMS and wanted to give a "real" CMS a try. The experience landed me a job at an agency that specifically wanted ExpressionEngine experience, so I guess it worked!

- **2018-2023:** A mostly functional bash terminal emulator written entirely in JavaScript. Around this time I was less interested in blogging and more into development and systems work, probably managing Kubernetes clusters. I wanted my website to be more of a calling card, letting my work on GitHub speak for itself. Instead of making anything resembling an actual website, I made a full-screen terminal emulator using [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js) and a bash-like terminal that I wrote from scratch. You `ls` to list files, `cat` files to read them, or `open` them to open links in a new tab or view images and markdown in a modal. You can even `reboot` to reload the website!

  I'm still very proud of how this iteration of my website turned out, but the single-page, interactive nature of it made me all but disappear from search engine results, leaving my arch-nemesis [Keith Bartholomew from the University of Utah](https://nitc.trec.pdx.edu/research/researcher/Bartholomew/3826) as the most findable Keith on the Internet.

- **2023-present:** Next.js, prerendered as a static site. I wanted to keep the terminal emulator look-and-feel, but have something that behaved more like a traditional website. As I mentioned in ["Back to Blogging"](/blog/posts/2023-11-24-back-to-blogging/), I wanted to get back into writing because I noticed that many of the professional software developers I look up to are prolific writers.

## The Frontend Stack

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) site. I'm using the `output: "export"` setting to bundle the entire thing as static HTML files so I can host it on any static-site platform at nearly zero cost. My blog posts are all Markdown (MDX) files, and I use a small collection of packages to parse them and their frontmatter and scaffold out navigation for the site.

Next.js is a borderline boring decision to make in 2023. I could have used an even more boring static site generator like Jekyll, but Next.js gives me the opportunity to pivot this static site into more interactivity if I want to do that in the future. It's also what I'm using at work right now, so I'm very comfortable with it.

I'm using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) to manage the styling. A big hurdle there was writing a bunch of `@apply` expressions with regular CSS selectors to apply the Tailwind utilities to the content in my blog posts, which usually get rendered without any inline styling.

## The Hosting Stack

I made the boring decision with Next.js and Tailwind, so I had some room to be _slightly less_ boring with the hosting. Hosting static websites is incredibly easy these days. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and [CloudFlare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) will all serve static sites with a custom domain for free, with zero effort on my part.

But where's the fun in that?

My website has always been a way for me to experiment with my professional interests, and these days my interests are shifting more towards infrastructure, specifically on AWS. Boutique static hosting providers aren't always a great fit for large companies...can I build a similar experience using AWS?

### <strike>AWS Amplify</strike>

I gave AWS Amplify a shot at first…it works well with both static and dynamic sites, and has integrations that let you add custom domains and distribute the site behind a CDN like CloudFront. However, I found that the only way to deploy a site to AWS Amplify is using their proprietary build system. This build system was a little difficult to use, and **very** expensive (you pay per minute of build time). In just a few days of testing, I had already racked up a bill larger than what I wanted to spend to host the site for an entire month.

Amplify is still an interesting product for applications that absolutely need server-side behavior, but it wasn't a good fit for my static-site needs.

### CloudFront and S3

The obvious AWS tools for a static site are [CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html) and [S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html). Given how simple and common this use case is, I'm surprised at how much work it is to get a working site using them.

> AWS recently announced the [CloudFront Hosting Toolkit](https://github.com/awslabs/cloudfront-hosting-toolkit) which is a CLI that claims to make this a lot easier.

After building my site with `npx next build`, I get a folder named `out/` that contains all of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images that my site needs. I then upload them to an S3 bucket under a prefix that includes the current Git commit SHA. This keeps the files from each individual build isolated, which lets me control when I start serving a new version to visitors. It also makes it easy to roll back a change, because I still have a complete set of files from each previous version.

I have a CloudFront distribution that uses the S3 bucket as an origin. Because my files are uploaded to S3 under random prefixes, I configure the origin path to use the same prefix as whichever version I want to serve.When I publish a new version of the site, I update the origin path to the new version's commit SHA.

This simple connection of CloudFront and S3 mostly works, but there's still an important gap: if I try to view a path like `/blog/`, most intelligent web servers know to serve the file `/blog/index.html`. S3 is not this intelligent. To work around this, I created a [Lambda@Edge function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-edge.html) that appends `index.html` to requests that don't already include a file extension. This isn't perfect (what if you wanted to load a file without an extension?) but it works well enough for me.

### DNS and TLS

The common way to use a custom domain with CloudFront is to make a CNAME record from your domain to the distribution's domain. Because my website doesn't have any prefixes like `www` in front of it, it's called the "domain apex" and most DNS providers won't let you create a CNAME as the domain apex.

[Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/Welcome.html), the AWS DNS service, has a workaround: you can make records that are aliases to other AWS resources, including the domain apex record. So I used Route 53 to create a record named `keithbartholomew.com` that is an alias to my CloudFront distribution. This means that when DNS clients request my domain, it resolves _directly_ to the IP addresses of the CloudFront distribution!

Managing TLS certificates has gotten a lot easier since [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) rocked the world in 2015. Getting automatically-renewed certificates for free is pretty much expected these days, but some providers make it easier than others.

Luckily, because my DNS is hosted by Route53, [AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html) is able to automatically integrate with it to validate my ownership of the domain, issue, and perpetually renew a certificate for my website. It also attaches easily to the CloudFront distribution!

### Serverless Functions

I don't have a reason to use this right now, but I have also configured an [API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html) as a dynamic origin to supplement my static site. I might use this for a contact form or something in the future.

If you visit [https://keithbartholomew.com/functions/cloudfront-origin-test](https://keithbartholomew.com/functions/cloudfront-origin-test), CloudFront will forward your request to the API Gateway, where a simple Lambda will tell you where you're from.

> The location data is derived from CloudFront's viewer data, which isn't always reliable. You might get told that your location is `undefined`!

## The Deployment process

[It's all open source!](https://github.com/ktbartholomew/keithbartholomew.com/blob/master/.github/workflows/node.js.yml). I use GitHub actions to build the Next.js site, upload the contents to S3, then deploy a CloudFormation stack that configures everything I've described above.
