  Discover how I delved into privacy-focused analytics with Plausible, shedding light on my website's traffic without compromising user data to ad-tech giants, and learn why it's a game-changer for understanding audience engagement.

I’ve added [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/) to this site, probably temporarily and mostly out of idle curiosity. I really like the new wave of privacy-focused analytics tools (like Plausible, and their competitor [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/)). I think it's very important to understand a website's traffic and what content is performing well, but not at the cost of handing all your users’ data to giant ad-tech monsters like Google.

The plausible JavaScript snippet is ridiculously simple, and adding it to a website like this couldn't be easier. I even went through the extra headache of [proxying Plausible through CloudFront](https://plausible.io/docs/proxy/guides/cloudfront) to avoid certain adblockers, and even that was easy and well-documented.

Having analytics on a site like this is pretty useless. I have about 15 unique visitors so far (one of whom is me), and most of them are getting sent to [one of my blog posts](https://keithbartholomew.com/blog/posts/2023-12-20-how-to-use-websockets-with-nextjs/) that has happened to show up in a common Google search.

However, before adding Plausible I didn't know any of that information about my site's traffic...so now I know.
