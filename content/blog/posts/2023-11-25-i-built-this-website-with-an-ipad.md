  I managed to create a website entirely on my iPad using GitHub Codespaces, 
  facing some challenges with iPadOS along the way, but the integrated terminal
  in Codespaces proved to be a valuable tool for controlling my workflow.

I built this entire website using only an iPad. Why? Mostly just to see if I could. The experience was…not great, but it got the job done.

### GitHub Codespaces

The main tool I used was GitHub Codespaces, which works pretty well in Safari. All of the details that Codespaces can actually control are pretty much perfect; the biggest headaches are related to how iPadOS manages the clipboard. I consistently had issues copy/pasting snippets of code from other websites into the Codespaces editor.

The integrated terminal in the Codespace was a life-saver…being able to run any CLI commands gave me a lot of control over my workflow. I was able to stop the Codespace whenever I finished working to save a little money, but leaving the Codespace turned off also persisted all of the customizations I had done. This was really nice because I was able to turn the Codepsace off and on and pick up exactly where I had left off during my last session.

Having to switch tabs from the Codespace to another tab to see the work-in-progress website was a little annoying, especially when making lots of iterative visual changes. I tried working around this by doing the “Add to Home Screen” trick on the Codespaces tab so that, using Mission Control, I could have the editor open in one window and the web browser open in another. This worked nicely at making both apps partially visible at once, but I had tons of issues with keyboard focus every time I returned to the Codespace. I had to click around a bunch of random elements before my keyboard input would go to the right place. That was very annoying and negated the benefits of having multiple windows open.
